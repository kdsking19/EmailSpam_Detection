# Spam Email Detection

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A machine learning project to classify emails as spam or not spam.

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a spam filter using machine learning techniques to automatically classify emails into two categories: spam and not spam (ham). The goal is to develop an accurate and efficient model that can effectively identify and filter out spam emails from a given dataset.

## Features

- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for email classification.
- Provides accuracy metrics and evaluation results.
- Easy-to-use interface for testing and deployment.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:

- **Data Preparation:**
  - Explanation of how the dataset is processed and prepared for model training.

- **Model Training:**
  - Details on the machine learning algorithms used, training process, and parameter tuning.

- **Evaluation:**
  - Metrics used to evaluate the performance of the trained model.

- **Deployment:**
  - Instructions or links for deploying the trained model for practical use.
